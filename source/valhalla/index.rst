Abilities
---------
The abilities in this game are very strong and still balanced. The way to get new abilities in Valhalla is through exploration. There are icons that show you where new abilities are.
You have to clear the area and sometimes solve a puzzle to get to it. Once it is learned you can equip it and enjoy. There are many abilities in this game and you are allowed to equip 4 melee type abilities and 4 bow abilities at any given time.

Gameplay
--------
Everything runs very well and the story is a lot of fun to play. The story is a bit slow so some people may not like that, but it makes the game last a lot longer.
Another big this is that you are able to play as different variants of the same main character which makes the experience different depending on what you pick. You can be a male version, a female version, and a non-binary version.
