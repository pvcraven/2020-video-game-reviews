Dark Souls 3
============

Dark Souls 3 is a action role-playing game developed by none other than FromSoftware. FromSoftware is well known for creating the souls series which
has been taken as a very successful franchise and known for creating some of the hardest to play RPG's. The game was published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Dark Souls 3
is available for Xbox one, Playstation 4, and PC. Dark Souls 3 stands as the final game to the Dark Souls Trilogy as well as fourth Souls series game. Initially released in
Japan in 2016, Dark Souls 3 also features two DLC's: *Ashes of Ariandal* and *Ringed City*. Just when players thought the Nameless king was hard, they were introduced to DLC Bosses.

Overview
--------
Dark Souls 3 finds itself centered around the Kingdom of Lothric. The current time period is known as the **Age of Fire**, which is being maintained by the First Flame. A bell is rung
signifying the flame's demise. If the flame dies out then the **Age of Dark** will be ushered in, which will raise the cursed Undead. However to counteract
the death of the First Flame one must link the fire. Linking the fire is a ritual done by heroes and lords who have to sacrifice their souls to rekindle the First Flame. Prince Lothric
however, has chosen to abandon his post and watch the flame die. Whether he chose to because the Age of Fire and Dark are an endless cycle is unknown. In a desperate attempt to  find suitable linkers,
the bell resurrects previous lords who have linked the flame before to link it again. All but one of those lords shied away from that duty. At the same time, Sulyvahn self proclaims himself
as Pontiff and rules over *Irithyll of The Borreal Valley* and *Anor Londor* as a tyrant.

Plot
----
The player will take on the role of the **Ashen One**, who happens to be an Undead who failed at becoming a Lord of Cinder. Due to the failure the Ashen One is also known as Unkindled. You are tasked
with returning the stubborn Lords of Cinder to their thrones in the *Firelink Shrine* in order to link the flame. The task is not as simple as convincing the lords, the unkindled one must kill every
one of the lords to return them to their thrones.

Classes
-------
* Knight
* Mercenary
* Warrior
* Herald
* Thief
* Assassin
* Sorcerer
* Pyromancer
* Cleric
* Deprived

.. Note::
   For an added challenge try the deprived class which has lowest starting stats due to being soul level one.

Gameplay
--------
To dive into Dark Souls 3, for starters, you get to design your own character and pick your own class. Each class has its varying amount of set stats, but
starting players should try the knight class due to being well rounded and having a solid strength stat. What players may notice in their stat menus are a ton of different
stats which control different aspects of your character. For example, strength will increase your damage output and allow you to use heavier weapons. The endurance stat will
increase your stamina, allowing you to run longer and attack more often. Dark souls is a grind of a game and requires patience and persistence at building up your character. In
order to upgrade your stats you need to acquire souls, which you gain from slaying creatures and bosses. Souls are the currency in the game and you use souls
to purchase weapons, armor, miracles, spells, items, etc. Dark Souls is an immense game that requires the player to search every corner of the world to become successful. The
game contains many secrets and it's the player's right to discover them. It is well known that in dark souls, the player will die... a lot, and sometimes the death will not make
sense. Dark Souls players need to be able to keep track of their health bar, focus point or fp bar, and stamina bar. The player will also need to learn how use the roll
which grants brief invincibility, how to parry which will open enemies up to a critical attack, backstabbing, and how to wear armor and gear. Classes will determine your
offensive capabilities, as well as your ability to use weapons and spells to their full potential. Introduced to Dark Souls 3 are weapon arts/weapon skills which in most cases take FP to use.
Every weapon and shield has a weapon skill and knowing how and when to use them will make for an effective player.



Lords of Cinder
---------------
The Abyss Watchers of the Undead Legion are the first Lord of Cinder you will fight. Undying warriors who have made it their sole mission to eliminate the Abyss in order to protect their land. The importance of their land is the fact that it
is home to Farron the Wolf, whose blood linked the watchers together as a single being. Unfortunately for the Abyss Watchers, they had unknowingly succumbed to the abyss which has turned them on each other.
When fighting the Abyss Watchers, the first phase consists of killing a certain Abyss Watcher who does not share a health bar above their head. In the beginning of the fight the player
will be hunted by two Abyss Watchers and eventually a third one with red glowing eyes will spawn and attack the main abyss watcher. When killing the main Abyss Watcher, their blood will merge into one Abyss Watcher.
The fight is a simple one on one, but the Abyss Watcher's sword will be flaming and he will not go down without a fight.

.. Warning::
   The third Abyss Watcher is not friendly and will attack the player.

Yhorm the Giant is the second Lord of Cinder the player will come across. Known as the "reclusive lord of the *Profane Capital*", Yhorm is a giant who lead the people he conquered. Skilled in combat, especially
for a giant, Yhorm was abe to rise to that of a Lord of Cinder. Although Yhorm can take damage from normal weapons and spells, his immense health pool is vulnerable to one sword known as Storm Ruler.
Storm Ruler is located in the back of his boss room and the player has to charge up attacks in order to inflict serious damage. Halfway through his health pool, Yhorm will enter
phase 2 in which his weapon will be embered/start on fire. Yhorm will also play more aggressively. When fighting a giant always remember: Aim for the head!
.. Note::
   Storm Ruler is an interesting sword due to the ranged attack, however it is hardly effective on everything that isn't Yhorm.

Aldrich the Devourer of Gods is next up on the list. Aldrich is no pushover and can easily wipe out an Unkindled like a stain in a shamwow ad. Between aggressive melee attacks and his most dreaded
mass soul arrow attack, he is a force to be reckoned with. For starting players, Aldrich may take some time but note, he is weak to the Abyss Watcher weapons, lightning and fire, and thrust attacks.
The recommended plan of attack is to go for the hulking mass that is the back end of Aldrich, since he is like a half human half snail. Going for 1-3 hits  and backing off will ensure survival.
Aldrich also has the ability to teleport.

.. Note::
   Aldrich has a deadly mass soul arrow attack which tracks the player and seems to last forever. The trick is to wait till the shower comes as close to the player as possible and then start running to preserve stamina.

Lorian and Lothric are the final obstacle (but not the final boss) to getting closer to linking the flame. They are known as the twin princes since they fight together. Lorian acts like the muscle
being the one who attacks while Lothric will shoot spells at you. Like most dark souls bosses this boss or bosses has two phases. The first phase is defeating Lorian, who will be
revived by Lothric which starts phase 2. Phase 2 will consist of Lothric piggybacking off of Lorian. Lothric will shoot spells at you while lorian will teleport around the player and go for sword swings.
The two are formidable, especially when lothric combines his magic attacks with Lorian's Melee attacks.

.. Warning::
   When Lothric is reviving his brother be mindful of taking advantage of his vulnerability, because the revive leads into a devastating AOE blast.

Soul of Cinder is the final boss of the main storyline. He is a powerful foe boasting a large set of moves and abilities, after all he is a combination of all the other bosses. His first phase
consist of him having the ability switch weapons, which changes his attack patterns. He can choose between a staff, curved greatsword, and a pike. Phase 2, Soul of Cinder will start charging at you with a flaming Ultra greatsword which resembles the sword used in bonfires.
Watch out for his five move combo which will trap and instantly kill the player. By approaching the Soul of Cinder with patience, the player will eventually defeat the boss and then link the flame. The Soul of Cinder is by no means too sporadic,
meaning he has move sets which are easy to keep track of.

.. Warning::
   Second phase Soul of Cinder will have an overhead attack which he immediately leads into an AOE attack. When you see the signs, run.

Honest Review
-------------
Before Dark Souls 3, I have never played a souls series game or *Bloodborne*. What I can say is that Dark Souls 3 provides the perfect challenge for the average player. It takes a great a
player to give a game a chance and show persistence because Dark Souls 3 will test your mental limits. When I first played the game, it took 27 tries to kill the tutorial boss. My Second attempt
at the game, It took me 7 tries to kill the tutorial boss but then I lost interest again. The third time, I came back to the game and killed the tutorial boss on my first try and proceeded to play
the game and eventually I finished the game (with some help of course). I did solo the endgame boss, considered to be the hardest boss a.k.a The Nameless King. If you would like
