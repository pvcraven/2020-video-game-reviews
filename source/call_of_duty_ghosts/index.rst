Call of Duty Ghosts
===================

**COD Ghosts** is a first person shooter video game that was developed by the company *Infinite Ward* in 2013. *Ghosts* comes after the famous *COD Black Ops II* creating hate at all levels towards the ghosts community. 

Campaign
--------
At the beginning of the campaign mode you find yourself in the body of Logan Walker where throughout the campaign mode you transition into the astronaut specialist Baker, Sergeant Thompson. Later on to Elias Wlaker (Logan's Father), and then for the first time in Call of Duty history you can play as Riley, which is Logan's K9. 

Multiplayer
-----------
Multiplayer mode in *Call of Duty Ghosts* is pretty great, considering it was the first *Call of Duty* game I was allowed to play was epic. It had previous guns I was familiar with thanks to my cousins who would let me play *Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2*. According to actual reviews by professional video game reviewers the Multiplayer mode had intense upgrades from the previous game (*Call of Duty Black Ops II*) featuring several new maps and different attachments to sniper rifles and machine guns.

Maps
----
*Call of Duty Ghosts* had a vary good range of maps to choose from for every game. Below are my top 6 maps for the multiplayer online mode but you can find the entire 31 map list `here <https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Call_of_Duty:_Ghosts_Multiplayer_Maps>`_!

#. Freight
#. Warhawk
#. Stonehaven
#. Sovereign
#. Strikezone
#. Free Fall

.. note::

   For all the Husker fans Warhawk is the first Call of Duty map to take place in a town in Nebraska.
