Reviews

"I really enjoy the open world aspect and what the game has to offer. I am not at a high level in the game so I have not gotten the full experience. I like the limitations of traveling, like when it stops me from going to far from something. I also like how the enemies and the world level up with me so the monsters aren't one hits. The game gets herder as I level up so it stays a challenge. I also like the CO-OP experience so friends can help you when needed. I also like the wish mechanice using the gatcha concept. Its a smart way to take money from my wallet but its nice to roll cool items or characters. The only thing I don't like is its hard to have good gatcha rolls. I constantly spend money because it's all based on luck. Overall 4/5" - Anonymous
