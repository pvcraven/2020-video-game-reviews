.. note::
   This review was made by someone who played all previous games repeatedly after they came out.
   this opinion stems from that. Don't get your Jimmy's in a twist and say I didn't do my research.
   I assure you I have done plenty. 


Overview
========
Scarecrow has come back to envelop the city in fear with the help of a mercenary army and a mysterious figure known as the Arkham Knight.



Story
=====
The story for this game is forgettable. I have played through the game multiple times at this point and, aside from emotional scenes, I remembered nothing except the beginning of the game and the end. You spend most of the game trying to determine who the Arkham Knight is even though you figure it out pretty early from the game showing you flashbacks and repeated references to a certain character that is yet to show up. Adding the Joker back in was an interesting twist but I am tired of having the Joker in every batman game in existence. It is not like **Warner Bros.** does not have a million other villains to work with and has repeatedly referenced and depicted the different villains of Batman but oh no we have to have more Joker. Overall I enjoyed playing the game and doing the side missions much more than having to continue on with the main story.

Side Missions
=============
Side missions, as I stated before were much more enjoyable to me. They were short interesting stories about the criminals we have already seen but added new ones as well. Some side missions even tied up characters from previous games to give them a proper ending to their story. If you purchased the add-ons for this game you will also gain access to some additional side missions all adding reoccurring characters, but all have their own unique story and some have an ending to their story. Overall the side missions were something I could always look forward to while playing.

Gameplay
========
The gameplay for this game is the sole purpose I came back to play it again. The gameplay was vastly improved upon by incorporating gadgets into combat in a much easier way. In previous games, it was better to not use gadgets in combat because they were slow to use and were usually the reason why you get by enemies. In this game that has changed. The game fully supports gadget usage during combat by making them much quicker to use and adding a special attack with all gadgets at the cost of a combo move.

Stealth
=======

Stealth got the worse end of the stick in terms of gameplay. aside from the new gadgets for this game it's the same knock out one then run away system. Adding the fear attack on multiple foes did help switch things up a bit, but it inevitably felt like every other game after a while.

Gadgets
=======
This game features some returning gadgets from previous games and some new ones as well. This helped the game feel fresh with having new ways to go about encounters in stealth and new ways to take down thugs in combat.

The Riddler
===========
The Riddler questline is most of the exploration in this game and I thought it was a slog. Having to spend twenty minutes in a small area of the map because I did not scan something exactly how the game wants it was horrible and having the difficulty of collecting trophies either be staggering easy or having to solve a 100 piece puzzle for one was mildly irritating and annoying. I hated the Riddler in this game and have only completed his questline once out of the many times I have played this game because of it. 


The Batmobile
=============
I did not mind the bat-tank combat in the game, but I understand perfectly if you did not enjoy it whatsoever. I am not sure why **Warner Bros.** thought that batmobile combat was a good idea but it is what they went with. I enjoyed the car chases in the game much more than the car combat and that the batmobile felt like another tool under Batman's belt.

Visuals
=======
The visuals for this game, like most games nowadays, were very well done. The environments are filled with detail and was a privilege to witness.

Audio
=====
The audio was fairly well done. The music grew emotional during the emotional scenes, held back during tense scenes, and full of pride during action scenes. Sound effects were well done, but nothing really stands out. The sound design was very well done.

Conclusion
==========
*Batman: Arkham Knight* Is a mixed bag. The gameplay is good, but the story is not. Exploration was either easy or aggravating. The Batmobile was fun to play around with but was strange to be fighting with. Lastly, the audio and visuals were nice, but nothing popped out in the audio. My advice: wait for a sale and play at your discretion.
