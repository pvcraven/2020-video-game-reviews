Madden 21
=========

*LACE THEM CLEATS UP BOY!*

Madden 21 has been a game highly talked about in the sports gaming area. Highly known pros talk highly of the game because of the content generators that were used to create this magnificient game. So many different routes and area to take to enjoy your full madden experience!

**Franchise**:
--------------

Here is my favorite mode in the game. Go in as an owner of any team that you choose, then decide if you wanna use the teams current coach or build your own. You can also build your own player that can get drafted by other teams and build your player up throughout the season and make them the best player in the league. Once you have decided the role that you wanna play continue on and draft your team and start your season. Hopefully by the end of the season you have a great franchise started and can win the Super Bowl!

**Ultimate Team**:
------------------
This is where the magic happens inside the game, this is where everyone that plays madden competitively online against other players. Here you can build your dream team from any age of the NFL that a player played in. You can play with someone that hasnt been on a roster since 1970 and have someone from current teams on the same team. It is a true work of magic inside of the game. 

.. note:: Your team gets better as you level up in MUT and hit the auction house alot

**Superstar Knockout**:
-----------------------
Superstar knockout is a new mode that released with madden 21. It is a never before seen mode that lets you dive deep through playoffs in online play. Every round you make it through you can add another superstar player to your team to help build your superstar team to win the bracket for xp and madden points. In return madden points help you style out your personal character to show off online in the YARD!

**The Yard**:
-------------

This is the yard! This mode allows you to customize your own personal character and level him up and take him to compete in online matches in either 1v1 2v2 3v3 in backyard football. This game mode allows you to show how good your stick skills actually are and relaly brings out and shows us who truly dominates the gridiron. If you got enough guts and think you have enough skill then this is your game mode and this is where you belong!
